# Hi, I'm Kenneth Stewart.

Unlike most coders I came to it through a roundabouts way. For the last 15 years I've been involved in the Visual Effects industry, helping make blockbuster films for the big screen. While making CG explosions look real, keying greenscreen and painting out tracking markers, I also spent time designing and creating tools that would solve various technical challenges in my work. This rekindled and old dream of mine to become a mad scientist, sadly as there were few job openings for that occupation I have settled on the role of developer.
