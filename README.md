# Hi, I'm Kenneth Stewart
For the last 15 years I've been involved in the Visual Effects industry, helping make blockbuster films for the big screen. While making CG explosions look real, keying underlit greenscreens and painting out tracking markers, I also spent time designing and creating tools that would solve various technical problems in our work. Excited to be shifting gears to software development and bringing my weird and wonderful skillset to new challenges.
